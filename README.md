# Machine-Learning-project
Given various features, the aim is to build a predictive model to determine the income level for people in US. The income levels are binned at below 50K and above 50K
The data used in this project is imbalanced. In real life, some extremely critical situations result in imbalanced data sets. For example – fraud detection, cancer detection, manufacturing defects, online ads conversion etc. Thus, having prior experience of working on such data might rule the situation in your favor (worth a try!).

Furthermore, some characteristics of this project which makes it a worthy project include:

Working on imbalanced data sets is tricky. Simple classification algorithms tend to struggle in such situations.
The data is fairly large and high dimensional. Hence, this would help you understand & overcome machine’s memory issues.
This project will demonstrate your programming, data analysis and machine learning skills.
Working on such projects driven by self – desire will help recruiters understand:
You are a self motivated person
Mostly, self learners tend to give up. But, you have really put in hard work to reach where you are.
If not job, this project will give you enough confidence & knowledge that you can build more ML projects on your own. Once you have completed this project, put in on your GitHub repo and showcase it to the world. Leave the link in the comments below to showcase your motivation – you never know when a recruiter drops by!
