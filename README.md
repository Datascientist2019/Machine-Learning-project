# Machine-Learning-project
Given various features, the aim is to build a predictive model to determine the income level for people in US. The income levels are binned at below 50K and above 50K
The data used in this project is imbalanced. In real life, some extremely critical situations result in imbalanced data sets. For example – fraud detection, cancer detection, manufacturing defects, online ads conversion etc. Thus, having prior experience of working on such data might rule the situation in your favor (worth a try!).

Furthermore, some characteristics of this project which makes it a worthy project include:

Working on imbalanced data sets is tricky. Simple classification algorithms tend to struggle in such situations.
The data is fairly large and high dimensional. Hence, this would help you understand & overcome machine’s memory issues.
This project will demonstrate your programming, data analysis and machine learning skills.
Working on such projects driven by self – desire will help recruiters understand:
You are a self motivated person
